<h3>Site 1</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is the URL?
How did you get there? Did you follow a link from another site, from social media, from a search engine, etc?</strong></li>

<p>
	https://www.fiverr.com/
	<br>
	<br>
	I found the site while naviagting reddit, Reddit uses cookies and reccommended me the site (advertising). The only information given along the link was that it was a freelancing site.

<br>

<li><strong>How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way?</strong></li>
<br>
 <p>The design looks professional, fresh and trendy. It makes me think that its target visitors are young professionals. The use of images and colours in addition to an intuitive interface makes the site appear simple and professional.</p>
<br>

<li><strong>Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?</strong></li>

<p>The navigation in the site it's very intuitive, whatever you're trying to find it's easy to reach. The first thing I get to see in the site is a large image and a search engine, under the search engine there are buttons of some of the most popular searches. In the navigation bar above the main image there are different categories and there's one highlighted button to join the site.</p>

<br>

<li><strong>What parts of the site are interactive?</strong></li>
<p> Overall, everything on the navigation bar, the search engine, the tags and the categories is clickable and interactive to some degree. There are images that lead to other pages within the site. The search engine is visible at the top of the navigation bar even if you scroll down the page.
	<br>
<p>In addition to that, after clicking into different categories the search result are filtered depending on what I'm looking for. There's a rating system for freelancers and after hiring a service you can rate and write a review.</p>

<br>

<li><strong>How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful?</strong></li>

<p>I find the website visually very appealing and eye-catching. The site is colorful but it doesn't make an excessive use of contrasts, instead it uses soft, cold colors. The design is very interesting and variated even within the homepage.</p>
<p>In the different categories, the design is more standarized and copy-pasted into all the categories. It's very simple but it works better that way.</p>

<br>

<li><strong>is one thing you would change about this site?</strong></li>
<p> I like how the site it's designed, it's very close to what I'd consider my ideal website. However, I find that the navigating experience is suddenly broken by the need to scroll down. This is especially noticeable on the homepage as the design changes radically as you scroll down...which on the other hand makes it slightly confusing and overwhelming if you're not acquainted with interactive websites.</p></ul>


<br>

<h3>Site 2</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is the URL?
How did you get there? Did you follow a link from another site, from social media, from a search engine, etc?</strong></li>
<p> The site's URL is https://www.forocoches.com/</p>
<br>
<p>I got an invitation to join the forum through a friend, the invitation was a link that redirected me to the registration page. Once I registered I appeared on the site's main page and started noticing the main features.
</p>

<br>

<li><strong>How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way?</strong></li>
<p>The website looks rather outdated, it has an early 2000's look. After doing my research and reading some posts I discovered the forum was created in 2003 and its design hasn't changed ever since. Orange is color of most of the site's typography, the logo seems old and the shapes of the few buttons look too sharp to be modern.</p>
	

</p>

<br>

<li><strong>Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?</strong></li>
<p>As someone who uses message boards on a daily basis I find the navigation very simple compared to other message boards such as Reddit or 4Chan forums. In comparison, this site seems very familiar and easy to use. Answering other people's posts is really easy, though adding images, videos or emojis to the messages is fairly difficult. I found also difficult to create my own post as there wasn't any button to create a post.</p>
	
</p>
<br>

<li><strong>What parts of the site are interactive?</strong></li>
<p> The site doesn't have too many interactive options aside from answering and creating posts. There are some links that lead to social media and the option to pin and subscribe to posts you liked.</p>

<br>

<li><strong>How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful?</strong></li>
<p>The site per se it's not beautiful unless you're nostalgic. It looks very outdated, but the interesting content of the posts makes up for the simplicity of the site. I must also praise how well-organized the site is, there are different forums depending on the category: employment, general, cars/vehicles, travel and economics.</p>
	
</p>
<br>

<li><strong>is one thing you would change about this site?</strong></li>

<p>Definitely I would change the design. The contents of the site are already very interesting but the simplicity of the design breaks completely the atmosphere. While I understand it's very important to stay focused and not to get distracted by the design, I know a redesign that kept the essence of the forum would be very beneficial and may potentially attract new users.</p></ul>

<p>https://www.cotilleando.com/</p>
<br>
<p>I found the site through google's search engine. I was looking for gossip websites and this link to a message board popped up.</p>
