<h3>Site 1</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is the URL?
How did you get there? Did you follow a link from another site, from social media, from a search engine, etc?</strong></li>

<p>
	https://www.fiverr.com/
	<br>
	<br>
	I found the site while naviagting reddit, Reddit uses cookies and reccommended me the site (advertising). The only information given along the link was that it was a freelancing site.

<br>

<li><strong>How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way?</strong></li>
<br>
 <p>The design looks professional, fresh and trendy. It makes me think that its target visitors are young professionals. The use of images and colours in addition to an intuitive interface makes the site appear simple and professional.</p>
<br>

<li><strong>Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?</strong></li>

<p>The navigation in the site it's very intuitive, whatever you're trying to find it's easy to reach. The first thing I get to see in the site is a large image and a search engine, under the search engine there are buttons of some of the most popular searches. In the navigation bar above the main image there are different categories and there's one highlighted button to join the site.</p>

<br>

<li><strong>What parts of the site are interactive?</strong></li>
<p> Overall, everything on the navigation bar, the search engine, the tags and the categories is clickable and interactive to some degree. There are images that lead to other pages within the site. The search engine is visible at the top of the navigation bar even if you scroll down the page.
	<br>
<p>In addition to that, after clicking into different categories the search result are filtered depending on what I'm looking for. There's a rating system for freelancers and after hiring a service you can rate and write a review.</p>

<br>

<li><strong>How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful?</strong></li>

<p>I find the website visually very appealing and eye-catching. The site is colorful but it doesn't make an excessive use of contrasts, instead it uses soft, cold colors. The design is very interesting and variated even within the homepage.</p>
<p>In the different categories, the design is more standarized and copy-pasted into all the categories. It's very simple but it works better that way.</p>

<br>

<li><strong>What is one thing you would change about this site?</strong></li>
<br>
<p> I like how the site it's designed, it's very close to what I'd consider my ideal website. However, I find that the navigating experience is suddenly broken by the need to scroll down. This is especially noticeable on the homepage as the design changes radically as you scroll down...which on the other hand makes it slightly confusing and overwhelming if you're not acquainted with interactive websites.</p></ul>


<br>

<h3>Site 2</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is the URL?
How did you get there? Did you follow a link from another site, from social media, from a search engine, etc?</strong></li>
<p> The site's URL is https://www.forocoches.com/</p>
<br>
<p>I got an invitation to join the forum through a friend, the invitation was a link that redirected me to the registration page. Once I registered I appeared on the site's main page and started noticing the main features.
</p>

<br>

<li><strong>How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way?</strong></li>
<p>The website looks rather outdated, it has an early 2000's look. After doing my research and reading some posts I discovered the forum was created in 2003 and its design hasn't changed ever since. Orange is color of most of the site's typography, the logo seems old and the shapes of the few buttons look too sharp to be modern.</p>
	

</p>

<br>

<li><strong>Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?</strong></li>
<p>As someone who uses message boards on a daily basis I find the navigation very simple compared to other message boards such as Reddit or 4Chan forums. In comparison, this site seems very familiar and easy to use. Answering other people's posts is really easy, though adding images, videos or emojis to the messages is fairly difficult. I found also difficult to create my own post as there wasn't any button to create a post.</p>
	

<br>

<li><strong>What parts of the site are interactive?</strong></li>
<p> The site doesn't have too many interactive options aside from answering and creating posts. There are some links that lead to social media and the option to pin and subscribe to posts you liked.</p>

<br>

<li><strong>How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful?</strong></li>
<p>The site per se it's not beautiful unless you're nostalgic. It looks very outdated, but the interesting content of the posts makes up for the simplicity of the site. I must also praise how well-organized the site is, there are different forums depending on the category: employment, general, cars/vehicles, travel and economics.</p>
	

<br>

<li><strong>What is one thing you would change about this site?</strong></li>

<p>Definitely I would change the design. The contents of the site are already very interesting but the simplicity of the design breaks completely the atmosphere. While I understand it's very important to stay focused and not to get distracted by the design, I know a redesign that kept the essence of the forum would be very beneficial and may potentially attract new users.</p></ul>

<h3>Site 3</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is the URL?
How did you get there? Did you follow a link from another site, from social media, from a search engine, etc?</strong></li>
<p>https://www.cotilleando.com/</p>
<br>
<p>I found the site through google's search engine. I was looking for gossip websites and this link to a message board popped up. 
<br>
I thought it would be an interesting addition to my derive as I already have a message board whose design was rather minimalistic and I wanted to compare both sites.</p>
	


<br>

<li><strong>How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way?</strong></li>

<p> The design of the site is simple but current, it's a message board with few categories and threads to follow. It looks more modern than the other forum, this site incorporates an interesting logo, a news section and images in the main page. The use of miniatures and icons also makes it look modern. Also it's very noticeable that the website target audience is adult women, the logo and the kind of news found are mostly about gossip...and its most read thread is about the Spanish Royal family.
</p>

<br>

<li><strong>Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?</strong></li>
<p> The naviagtion system is very intuitive and the site makes it easy to access to everything. The main page has most of the things you could possibly look for: categories, threads, news and a login button. It also has a nice feature that shows who was the last person to post a comment, when and in which thread. The interface also looks very user-friendly and the typeface used is easy to read.</p>

<br>

<li><strong>What parts of the site are interactive?</strong></li>
<p>The website doesn't have many interactive options, all you can click is the images (that redirect to a news page or a thread), the thread titles and once within the thread you can rate the posts as well as add images and emojis to your answer. There are also some categories that have clickable buttons, but overall the interaction is very limited.</p>

<br>

<li><strong>How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful?</strong></li>
<p> I think this website is useful, the content and news published are pretty interesting. The design is appealing and nice, it serves its purpose very well and it's easy to navigate. In addition to that, it makes an excellent use of colour variations.</p>

<br>

<li><strong>What is one thing you would change about this site?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The only downside and flaw when it comes to design, is that the header images for news look poorly escaled and pixelated. More than a flaw in the design I think it's a poor choice of the images.</p>

<br>

<h3>Site 4</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is the URL?
How did you get there? Did you follow a link from another site, from social media, from a search engine, etc?</strong></li>
<p>https://dribbble.com/shots</p>
<br>
<p>I got the link from Reddit, I was told the webpage was like "Linked In for designers"</p>

<br>

<li><strong>How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way?</strong></li>
<p>The design seems current and trendy. It's a website for designers and it meets with all the expectations you could possibly have. Despite being decorated, it's not overdone and it's visually appealing.</p>

<br>

<li><strong>Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?</strong></li>
<p>The navigation system is easy to understand, it's very familiar. The interface looks like a wall full of pictures taken with a polaroid camera, each picture contains a design. Once you click into a design you can see the details, comment and rate the design.</p>

<br>

<li><strong>What parts of the site are interactive?</strong></li>
<p>Almost every single element, except the background is interactive to some degree. The navigation bar has a search engine that allows you to look for specific design tags such as illustration, graphic design and editorial design, etc. The images are clickable and some are interactive (videos and animation). Other clickable elements are images, comments, share buttons and like buttons. You can visit other user's profiles and subscribe.</p>

<br>

<li><strong>How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful?</strong></li>
<p> I find the site extremely useful, the design is interesting and fresh and it makes me want to navigate some more. The navigation is really easy and intuitive even for new users. Uploading a design is also an easy task.</p>

<br>

<li><strong>What is one thing you would change about this site?</strong></li>
<p> I would change the maximum size per files allowed. I find that being limited to an 800x800px images makes appreciating design a difficult task. Also it only accepts jpg and png images. The size and format limitations are something I would definitely change, especially because other portfolio websites such as Behance don't have the file/format limitation despite being slightly outdated by today's standards.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Site 5</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is the URL?
How did you get there? Did you follow a link from another site, from social media, from a search engine, etc?</strong></li>
<p>https://www.ascodevida.com/</p>
<br>
<p>I found the link in a message board, they were recommending websites to kill time.

<li><strong>How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way?</strong></li>
<p>The web is a site where people publish anecdotes that ruined their day. The design it's extremely simple and minimalistic, but it's timeless and looks current despite not having changed its design for over 10 years.</p>

<br>

<li><strong>Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?</strong></li>
<p>The navigation system is easy to understand. There's no navigation bar but instead all the elements are scattered all over the page but with some order. The anecdotes appear in small boxes in the middle, while the buttons and the navigation bar are at the top or in the side. In the side there's also the "anecdote of the day", which is the most rated by the users.</p>
<br>

<li><strong>What parts of the site are interactive?</strong></li>
<p> The site has many interactive elements, you can click the boxes and comment,rate and share the anecdotes. The comments can also be up and downvoted. The buttons at the top of the page classify different anecdotes, you can search by the most voted, the least voted, the "karma" disgraces, random anecdotes and two more buttons to publish your own anecdote and one to moderate other people's before they are published.
<br>
It is also possible to select specific topics: spicy, love, money, family, health, friendship, work...
</p>
<br>

<li><strong>How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful?</strong></li>
<p> I like the site and I quickly found myself drawn to the page and having scrolled over 200 stories. The design doesn't seem to age and it's visually appealing despite having a dark background.</p>

<br>

<li><strong>is one thing you would change about this site?</strong></li>
<p>I don't like the fact that there aren't any "page change" buttons. You get new anecdotes by scrolling down instead of just displaying 20-30 anecdotes per page.</p>
</ul>
